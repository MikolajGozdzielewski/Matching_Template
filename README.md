Creating a program that recognizes a specific template ("Kevin") in an image without using existing library solutionsâ€”a fully custom implementation of template matching. The template in the image may have a different size or be rotated, requiring a custom scale- and rotation-invariant template matching implementation. The project created as part of the Contemporary Computational Tools course.
